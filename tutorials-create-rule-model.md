# Tutorial: Creating a rule-based model
{: #wks_tutrule_intro}

This tutorial helps you understand how to create a rule-based model that you can use to find text patterns that you define in documents.
{: shortdesc}

You will build a model that can find text in documents that matches the pattern `month day, year`. For example, the model would find the date reference *May 1, 2010*. Before you define the rule pattern itself, you will create artifacts that will help you build the pattern, including a dictionary class that recognizes month mentions and a regular expression class that recognizes year mentions in text.

## Learning objectives

After you complete this tutorial, you will know how to perform the following tasks:

- Create classes
- Add documents for defining rules
- Associate dictionaries with classes
- Define regular expressions to capture sequences of characters
- Define rules

This tutorial should take approximately 30 minutes to finish. If you explore other concepts related to this tutorial, it could take longer to complete.

## Prerequisites

You must have successfully completed [Tutorial: Creating a project](/docs/services/knowledge-studio/tutorials-create-project.html).

You must have at least one user ID in either the ADMIN or PROJECTMANAGER role. For information about creating users, see [Assembling a team](/docs/services/knowledge-studio/team.html).

## Results

After completing this tutorial, you will have a rule-based model that you can be used by other {{site.data.keyword.watson}} services to find text patterns in documents.

## Lesson 1: Adding a dictionary of months
{: #wks_tutless_rule1}

In this lesson, you will learn how to add a dictionary to a project in {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}}. The dictionary contains terms related to the months of the year.

### About this task

In a later lesson, you will define a class based on this dictionary. By doing so, all terms in this dictionary that are found in documents will be automatically annotated as a mention of the associated class type. For more information about dictionaries, see [Adding dictionaries to a project](/docs/services/knowledge-studio/artifacts.html#wks_projdictionaries).

### Procedure

1. Download the <a target="_blank" href="https://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/doc-tutorial-downloads/knowledge-studio/dictionary-items-month.csv" download>`dictionary-items-month.csv`<img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon" title="External link icon" class="style-scope doc-content"></a> file to your computer. This file contains dictionary terms in CSV format, suitable for importing into a {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} dictionary.
1. Within your project, click **Dictionaries** in the page header.
1. Click the **Add** icon (![_](images/wks_tut_dict_add.jpg)) to add a dictionary.

    ![Shows the user clicking the Import button to import the documents-new.csv file from the Documents panel of the Rules page.](images/rule-doc-add2.jpg)

    A set of documents is displayed in the main Documents page.

    ![Shows three of the fourteen documents that were added to the rule editor. Shows the document title and an excerpt from the beginning of each document. There is also a delete icon next to each document that you can use to delete the document.](images/rule-doc-add3.jpg)

## Lesson 3: Creating classes
{: #wks_tutless_rule3}

In this lesson, you will learn how to define classes that you will use when you define a rule.

### About this task

For more information about classes, see [Rules](/docs/services/knowledge-studio/rule-annotator.html).

### Procedure

1. From the **Rules** page of your project, click the **Add a class** icon next to **Class** in the side panel.

    ![Shows the user clicking the plus sign next to the label Class in the Class side panel of the Rules page.](images/rule-class-add0.jpg)

1. Enter `DictMonth` as the class name, and then click **Add**.

    ![Shows the user clicking the Add button after naming the new class DictMonth in the Class side panel of the Rules page.](images/rule-class-add1.jpg)

    The new class is displayed in the Class side panel.

    ![Shows the DictMonth class selected in the Class side panel of the Rules page.](images/rule-class-find0.jpg)

## Lesson 4: Associating a dictionary with a class
{: #wks_tutless_rule4}

In this lesson, you will learn how to use a dictionary in the rule editor.

### Procedure

1. From the **Rules** page of your project, click the **Dictionary** tab in the side panel, and then click the **Month dictionary** that you created earlier.

    ![Shows a user clicking the Month dictionary from the Dictiionary tab of the side panel of the Rules page.](images/rule-dict-map0.jpg)

1. Select `DictMonth` from the **Class** field drop-down list, and then click **Save**.

    ![Shows a user clicking the Save button after associating the DictMonth class with the Month dictionary in the Dictionaries tab of the side panel of the Rules page.](images/rule-dict-map1.jpg)

    The class is associated with the dictionary.

    ![Shows that the DictMonth class is associated with the Month dictionary in the Dictionaries panel of the Rule page.](images/rule-dict-map2.jpg)

### Results

Any references to terms in the dictionary that are found in the documents associated with the rule editor are annotated as *DictMonth* class mentions. You will see proof that these references have been annotated in the next lesson.

## Lesson 5: Finding class annotations in documents
{: #wks_tutless_rule5}

In this lesson, you will learn how to find class annotations in rule editor documents.

### Procedure

1. Within your project, click **Rules** in the banner or the navigation menu.
1. In the Class side panel, find the **DictMonth** class that you defined earlier. Click the **Search annotations in documents** icon next to it.

    ![Shows the user clicking the magnifying glass icon next to the DictMonth class to search for annotations of the DictMonth class in documents from the Class side panel of the Rules page.](images/rule-class-find0.jpg)

    The Find Annotations page is displayed and shows all of the documents that contain text references to months.

    ![Shows the Find Annotation page with excerpts from four documents that have months highlighted in their text in the same color (yellow) as the DictMonth class to indicate that they are mentions of the DictMonth class type.](images/rule-class-find1.jpg)

1. Click the **Technology - computerworld.com** document to view the full document. Notice that the text **February** is highlighted, which means it was annotated as a mention of the DictMonth class.

## Lesson 6: Defining a regular expression
{: #wks_tutless_rule6}

In this lesson, you will learn how to define a regular expression.

### About this task

You will define a regular expression that can find year patterns like *2009*.

For more information about defining regular expressions, see [Defining a rule](/docs/services/knowledge-studio/rule-annotator-define-rule.html).

### Procedure

1. From the **Rules** page of your project, click the **Add a class** icon (![_](images/wks_tut_dict_add.jpg)) next to **Class** in the side panel.
1. Enter `RegExpYear` as the class name, and click **Add**.

    ![Shows the user clicking the Add button after defining a new RegExpYear class in the Class side panel of the Rules page.](images/rule-regex-add00.jpg)

1. Click the **Regex** tab in the side panel, and then click the **Create a regular expression** icon next to **Regular Expressions**.

    ![Shows the user clicking the plus sign next to the Regular Expressions label in the Regex tab of the side panel in the Rules page.](images/rule-regex-add0.jpg)

1. Click **Add Entry**.

    ![Shows the user clicking the Add Entry button.](images/rule-regex-add1.jpg)

1. In the **Regular Expression** field, enter the following expression:

    ```
    (?:(?:19|20)[0-9]{2})
    ```
    {: screen}

    > **Note:** This regular expression finds years between 1900 and 2099.

1. Set the **Minimum Word Tokens** to `1` and the **Maximum Word Tokens** to `1`.

    The token settings specify that the time value must consist of 1 token.

1. Click **Add** to save the regular expression entry.

    ![Shows the customer clicking the Add button to define a regular expression.](images/rule-regex-add2.jpg)

1. In the side panel, enter `MyYearExp` as the regular expression name, and then select the *RegExpYear* class that you defined earlier from the drop-down list in the **Class** field.

    ![Shows the user choosing the RegExpYear class to associate with the MyYearExp regex.](images/rule-regex-add3.jpg)

1. Click **Save**.

    ![Shows the user clicking the Save button from the Regex tab of the Rules page to save the regular expression that they defined.](images/rule-regex-add4.jpg)

    After you save the regular expression, it is automatically applied to the sample documents. Any text strings that follow the pattern that you defined in the regular expression are annotated as mentions of the **RegExpYear** class.

1. To check whether the expression you defined is capturing time occurrences correctly, you can search for mentions. Click the **Search annotations in documents** icon next to the **RegExpYear** class in the Class side panel.

    ![Shows the user clicking the magnifying glass icon next to the RegExpYear class in the Class side panel of the Rules page.](images/rule-regex-add5.jpg)

    The Find Annotation page is displayed. Occurrences of year mentions are highlighted in the sample documents in which they occur.

    ![Shows years highlighted in excerpts from 8 of the sample documents.](images/rule-regex-add6.jpg)

## Lesson 7: Defining a rule
{: #unique_1166829415}

In this lesson, you will learn how to define a rule.

### About this task

You already defined a dictionary-based class for annotating month mentions. You also defined a regular expression that finds numeric values which represent a year. Now, you will define a rule that captures the sequence of a month followed by a number, a comma, and then a year. You will define a rule for date expressions like *September 21, 2016*.

For more information about defining rules, see [Defining a rule](/docs/services/knowledge-studio/rule-annotator-define-rule.html).

### Procedure

1. From the **Rules** page of your project, open the `Technology - computerworld.com` document.

    ![Shows the user opening the Technology - computerworld.com document.](images/rule-add0.jpg)

1. Select the text *February 3, 2009* in the document.

    ![Shows the text February 3, 2009 as being selected in the document.](images/rule-add1.jpg)

1. Click the **Rules** tab in the side panel, and then click the **Add a rule** icon.

    ![Shows the user clicking the plus sign next to Rules in the Rules tab of the side panel on the Rules page.](images/rule-add2.jpg)

    The rule editor shows a depiction of the rule pattern that you identified.

    ![Shows a depiction of the rule pattern in the main Rules page.](images/rule-add3.jpg)

    The text *February 3, 2009* is visible. A gray line that connects the cells in the depiction identifies which cells are currently part of the pattern.
    - The *DictMonth* class is part of the rule pattern instead of the text *February*. This selection is preferred because you want the model to find any month that is annotated by the *DictMonth* class as the first token in the date pattern instead of the text *February* only.
    - At the end of the rule, the year *2009* is already annotated as being a mention of the *RegExpYear* class. The *RegExpYear* class is part of the rule pattern instead of the number 2009. This selection is also preferred because you want the model to find any year that is annotated by the *RegExpYear* class as the last token in the date pattern instead of the specific text *2009* only.

    The number 3 and the comma (,) after it are shown as the second and third tokens in the pattern. As the pattern is currently specified, the model will find only occurrences of dates that specify the 3rd day of a month. We want the model to find dates that specify any day of the month, so next we will change the feature settings for the day token.

1. Above the day *3* cell, click the *Text* icon to open the feature settings for the token.

    ![Shows the user clicking the Text Feature Settings icon.](images/rule-add4.jpg)

    Currently, the rule is set to match the exact text *3*. We want it to match any number instead.

1. Change the feature setting to be numeric by selecting **Character Type : Numeric**, and then deselecting **Text : 3**.

    ![Shows the user clicking the Character Type : Number option as the feature setting for the 3 token.](images/rule-add5.jpg)

    You changed the definition for the number 3 cell.

    ![Shows the cell that represents the 3 token now has an Aa icon above it to indicate that any numeric value can match that token in the pattern.](images/rule-add6.jpg)

    The **Aa** icon indicates that instead of requiring the number to be equal to 3 exactly, it can be any number.

1. Do not change any settings for the comma token.

    We want the third token in the pattern to be a comma, so the current feature setting of *text : ,* is appropriate. In addition to a feature setting, each token has a repeat setting. The repeat setting specifies how many times the token can be repeated in the text for it to match the pattern. The current repeat setting of *Required (Exactly 1)* is also appropriate as specified.

    ![Shows the repeat settings for the comma token which are set to Exactly 1. ](images/rule-add7.jpg)

1. Assign a class to represent the pattern *DictMonth + numeric token + comma + RegExpYear*.

    In the row above the text, there are four cells that represent the four tokens that you selected from the document. To select all of the cells, select the first cell, and then press Shift + each additional cell. Enter `RuleDate` as the class name, and then click it to create the new class.

    ![Shows that all four cells in the top row have been selected and the span is being defined as the RuleDate class.](images/rule-add8.jpg)

    You have successfully defined the pattern for the rule.

1. In the Rules panel, enter `MyDateRule` as the name of this rule, and click **Save**.

    ![Shows the user naming the rule MyDateRule and clicking the Save button from the Rules tab of the Rules page to save it.](images/rule-add9.jpg)

    After you save the rule, it is automatically applied to the sample documents. If the `Technology - computerworld.com` document is still open in the rule editor, you will see that the *February 3, 2009* text in the document is now annotated as a mention of the RuleDate class.

    ![Shows text from in the Technology - computerworld.com document with only the text February 3, 2009 annotated as being a mention of the RuleDate class.](images/rule-add10.jpg)

    You can search for all occurrences of RuleDate class mentions in the sample documents by clicking the **Search annotation in documents** icon ( ![A magnifying glass to represent a search](images/filter_gray.png)) next to the *RuleDate* class from the Class side panel. It is a good practice to check whether all dates are being captured properly to confirm that you defined the pattern correctly.

    ![Shows the Find Annotations page with two documents that contain dates that match the rule pattern you just defined.](images/rule-add11.jpg)

## Lesson 8: Creating a rule annotator
